# XMLSitemapParser
Purpose is to parse website XML sitemaps, provide a criteria for what you'd like, expose a save-file type interface, and store the data.

Most of the processing can be designated to a single class - [ParseXMLSitemap](https://github.com/dev-segal/XMLSitemapParser/blob/master/app/src/main/java/media/utils/ParseXMLSitemap.java)

It's still very geared towards my use case of it, but I'll be working on generalizing/abstracting out functionality/behavior and objects so it remains clean, and provides room for extension.
